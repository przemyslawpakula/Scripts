# This script manages aptly publishes by listing and optionally dropping them.
# 
# It supports a dry-run mode to show what would be dropped without actually performing the deletion.
#
# Usage:
#   ./aptlypublishlist-drop.sh --dry-run   Show what would be dropped without deleting anything.
#   ./aptlypublishlist-drop.sh             Actually run script.
#
# To properly run this script, give it execute permissions and run it from the shell:
#   chmod +x aptlypublishlist-drop.sh
#
# The dry-run option is useful for verifying what changes the script will make before applying them.
